### Hypeparameter Analysis on Wide-Kernel CNNs

This repository is supplementary to our paper "Hyperparameter Analysis of Wide-Kernel CNN Architectures
in Industrial Fault Detection â€“ An Exploratory Study" for reproducing our proposed models and their performance. Furthermore, this repository contains the results of all the models in the parameter. 

### Requirements

Usage of our code requires many packages to be installed on your machine. The most important packages are listed below:

Numpy
Tensorflow
Keras
Pandas
Sklearn
