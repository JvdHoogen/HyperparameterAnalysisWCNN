### Hypeparameter Analysis on Wide-Kernel CNNs

Repository for Hyperparameter analysis on Wide-Kernel CNN models. This repository contains the hyperparameter search on the three used datasets, e.g, CWRU, Gearbox and Paderborn. In addition, in the folder "result_datasets" you will find the results of every Wide-Kernel CNN model configuration with its respective performance. These seperately stored datasets can be used to investigate what the influence of a certain hyperparameter configuration has on the performance of the model. 

Authors: Jurgen van den Hoogen, Dan Hudson, Stefan Bloemheuvel & Martin Atzmueller. 

#### For more information regarding the results from the experiments, please mail to j.o.d.hoogen@jads.nl.
